# TempleFlow: Deep Learning Final Project
### Hunter Karas and Arun Kavishwar

An AI framework to play the mobile app "Temple Run 2"

How we gathered the training data:

- This was a manual process. We filmed ourselves playing the game for short video segments, and gathered data of running into various obstacles. Using Adobe Photoshop, we converted these video clips to image sequences, and were able to turn this into large batches of data. As such, we were able to get ______ images to use, with different labels, to represent the different obstacles in the game.
